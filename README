This project contains tools I use to interface with/work with local MetaMap (http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov) installations on linux.

process_via_metamap.py
----------------------
Requires python 2.6. Uses the multiprocessing module to distribute lines to multiple copies of metamap. Right now due to some MetaMap weirdness it creates a single process per line, but it's still faster than SKR on an Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit VM with 4 processors and 2 GB of RAM.
